# Swift Institute

A layered Swift package ecosystem organized around shared conventions.

## What this is

Swift Institute is a set of layered Swift packages organized as separate GitHub
organizations, one per layer. The layers share dependency rules, naming
conventions, error handling, memory ownership, and API shape — so that
compile-time guarantees hold across the entire stack rather than stopping at
package boundaries.

| Layer | Organization | Role |
|-------|--------------|------|
| 1 | [swift-primitives](https://github.com/swift-primitives) | Atomic building blocks — buffer, geometry, algebra, memory, kernel |
| 2 | [swift-standards](https://github.com/swift-standards) + per-authority orgs | Specification implementations |
| 3 | [swift-foundations](https://github.com/swift-foundations) | Composed building blocks — IO, HTML, CSS, SVG, PDF, networking |
| 4 | Components | Opinionated assemblies — planned |
| 5 | Applications | End-user systems — planned |

> **Release in progress.** The organization links above are being made world-readable over the coming weeks. Some may currently 404; they resolve as each layer's release lands.

Layer 2 is an organization of organizations. Each standards authority has its
own GitHub organization hosting the packages it governs:
[swift-ietf](https://github.com/swift-ietf) (RFCs),
[swift-iso](https://github.com/swift-iso),
[swift-w3c](https://github.com/swift-w3c),
[swift-whatwg](https://github.com/swift-whatwg),
plus single-package organizations for IEEE, IEC, ECMA, INCITS, ARM, Intel,
RISC-V, and Microsoft.

| Consume an RFC or ISO specification | [swift-ietf](https://github.com/swift-ietf), [swift-iso](https://github.com/swift-iso), or the relevant per-authority org |
| Use composed building blocks (IO, HTML, CSS, SVG, PDF) | [swift-foundations](https://github.com/swift-foundations) |
| Read the blog | [swift-institute/swift-institute/tree/main/Blog](https://github.com/swift-institute/swift-institute/tree/main/Blog) |

## Status

Initial public alpha. The meta-repository
([swift-institute/swift-institute](https://github.com/swift-institute/swift-institute))
is public. The package layers it describes are being released repository by
repository over the coming weeks.
