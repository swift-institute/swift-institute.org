# DocC Landing Restructure and the Layers-Necessity SHOW

## What Happened

The session opened with a resume from `HANDOFF.md` ("improve swift-institute.org landing UX via DocC"). Work split into two phases.

**Phase 1 — structural restructure.** Three parallel research agents (marketing perspective, comparative 14-site study, DocC directive capabilities) wrote into `Research/`. The DocC-capabilities agent stalled on a Write-permission issue after 15 minutes, I took it over directly and produced `landing-page-docc-capabilities.md` by reading the swift-docc source + `swift.org/documentation/docc/data/documentation/*.json` endpoints (the rendered HTML is client-rendered and empty). Synthesized the three perspectives into `landing-page-user-journey.md` with 11 numbered decisions.

The user then overrode the original "present findings before implementing" instruction and asked for local implementation. I rewrote `Swift Institute.md` per decisions ②③⑤⑥⑦⑧⑪, created `Principles.md` holding the four moved principles, and added a minimal `theme-settings.json`. Local verification required a CI-equivalent build: `swift build --target "Swift Institute" -Xswiftc -emit-symbol-graph -Xswiftc -emit-symbol-graph-dir -Xswiftc "$(pwd)/.build/symbol-graphs"` followed by `xcrun docc convert "Swift Institute.docc" --additional-symbol-graph-dir .build/symbol-graphs --transform-for-static-hosting --output-path /tmp/si-docs`. Served at `http://localhost:8080/documentation/swift_institute/`. Not pushed — user direction was "just local work."

**Phase 2 — the progressive example.** User proposed a Tagged → Geometry → W3C CSS → swift-html progression to SHOW why the ecosystem has layers. I went through multiple failed drafts:

1. First draft: invented `typealias WidgetID = Tagged<Widget, UInt64>` as the Tagged station. Violated `[API-NAME-001]` (compound identifier) and was a category error — a Tagged demo, not a layers-necessity SHOW.
2. Second draft: used `.init(width: 100, height: 200)` on `Geometry.Size<2>`. Worked in the test-support build but not in production — `Tagged: ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` lives in test-support, not production. The correct production shape is `.init(width: .init(320), height: .init(200))`. User signalled this will change once `ExpressibleByIntegerLiteral` on Tagged lands.
3. Third draft: proposed swift-io as alternative. I dismissed it as "layers hidden behind `import IO`" based on README only. User called out: "lol you did not at all go into actual swift-io code to check." I went back and read the actual Package.swift — 20+ real dependencies (kernel, executor, memory, queue, async, primitives…), with partial layer visibility through `IO.default()`, `IO.events()`, `IO.Lifecycle.Error<IO.Error<E>>` case structure. The dismissal was unsupported.

Session ended with `/handoff` updating `HANDOFF.md` in place with a supervisor ground-rules block per `[HANDOFF-012]`.

## What Worked and What Didn't

**Worked:**
- Three independent research perspectives converged on the same findings (blog buried, abstract generic, Topics mixes reader-goal with architecture). Independent convergence is high-signal.
- The synthesis doc's 11 numbered decisions mapped cleanly onto DocC directives with verified `file:line` citations into swift-docc's own catalog. This made the implementation step mechanical.
- CI-equivalent local build caught the `kind: article` vs `kind: symbol` bug before any push. Without symbol graphs the JSON showed `topicSections: [{ generated: true, title: "Articles" }]` — flat auto-generated, losing the explicit 4-group structure. Symbol-graph-emit + `--additional-symbol-graph-dir` produced the correct shape.
- Writing the supervisor ground-rules block at `/handoff` time captured the session's hard-won constraints (no compound identifiers, no `.rawValue` bridge noise, no Tagged-demo framing, verify-before-asserting) in a form the next session must honor.

**Didn't work:**
- Three separate rounds of proposed example code written from README and header inspection instead of tracing call sites in `Sources/`. Each round the user caught a gap I should have caught myself.
- The swift-io dismissal. I wrote two full comparison tables positioning swift-io as weaker than the HTML progression without ever opening its Package.swift. When I finally did, the conclusion didn't flip entirely but the confidence stance I had communicated was unearned.
- First local DocC build without symbol graphs wasted a round and nearly led me to report "something's wrong with my Topics structure" when the build pipeline was the issue.
- Compound identifier `WidgetID` in a landing-page example. The landing page is the most-public surface in the ecosystem — exactly where code-surface compliance matters most — and I proposed a naming violation there. The fact that it was in a code BLOCK (not production source) doesn't matter; the reader sees it as exemplary.

**Where confidence was miscalibrated:**
- High confidence on "swift-io hides its layers" from README-only reading. Actual state: partially hidden, but `IO.Lifecycle.Error<IO.Error<E>>` case structure and the explicit strategy selectors (`IO.events()`, `IO.completions()`, `IO.blocking()`) do expose layer concerns.
- High confidence on `.init(width: 100, height: 200)` being production syntax based on seeing it in a test file. Missed the `import ... Test_Support` at the top.
- Low confidence on whether `@Links(visualStyle:)` works on a module root page — and that one was correct to be uncertain about. Still open; needs a 5-min experiment.

## Patterns and Root Causes

**Pattern 1: opinion-before-investigation.** Proposing positions about a package's capabilities from a surface skim (README, headers, directive docs) and then having to back-fill. Three distinct instances this session: `.init(320)` syntax, `WidgetID` typealias, swift-io dismissal. Same root cause in each — treating surface artifacts as ground truth when the `Sources/` directory is two seconds of `grep` away.

The existing memory rule `feedback_verify_prior_findings.md` says "Verify each finding against current code before synthesis." It applies here. I didn't apply it. The gap isn't knowledge of the rule, it's the reflex to reach for `grep` before drafting. This might warrant strengthening at the skill layer (specifically `[DOC-050]` Code Example Quality, which today mandates "domain-meaningful identifiers" but doesn't mandate source-traced types/inits).

**Pattern 2: category confusion in example design.** The progressive example is a *layers-necessity* SHOW. I kept treating it as a *Tagged* SHOW by instinct — because Tagged was the first station, I wanted to demonstrate Tagged standalone. But each station's job is to contribute to the composition chain, not to stand alone as a concept demo. The Tagged station's code is whatever carries the phantom-type identity forward into Geometry — not a standalone `WidgetID`.

This is a writing-craft problem, not a code problem. The fix is to keep asking "what is this station contributing to the overall argument?" and reject anything that doesn't answer. Worth capturing, not necessarily in a skill.

**Pattern 3: build-pipeline assumptions.** `xcrun docc convert` alone produces structurally different output than the CI pipeline (`swift build` with symbol-graph emit, then convert with `--additional-symbol-graph-dir`). The difference isn't a warning or a visible error — it's a `kind: article` vs `kind: symbol` flip that propagates through the entire JSON shape. Without running the CI-equivalent command, local verification can be confidently wrong. Two minutes of reading `.github/workflows/deploy-docs.yml` at the start would have shown me the exact command. I did that eventually but only after the first wrong build.

The deploy workflow is authoritative; local verification must match its command exactly. Worth an explicit note in DocC-adjacent skills / the landing-page skill-to-be, since the failure mode is invisible.

**Pattern 4: synthesis docs as accelerators.** The synthesis doc with 11 numbered decisions → directive table → file:line citations made the implementation phase feel mechanical. It didn't turn into design-in-flight because every decision already had a rendered verdict. When synthesis is done right, implementation is a translation step. This pattern could be worth documenting — research / synthesis / implementation as a three-phase pipeline where each phase's output is the next phase's input (vs. doing all three in the same breath and making errors in all three).

**Connection to prior sessions.** The `feedback_verify_prior_findings.md` memory came from a prior session that hit the same pattern-1 failure mode. It didn't prevent this session from recurring. Memory rules alone, without a reflex-level habit or a tool that enforces the check, are necessary but insufficient. The supervisor ground-rules block for next session encodes the rule more explicitly as a MUST, which is stronger than a memory.

## Action Items

- [ ] **[research]** Geometry (primitives) ↔ CSS.Length (W3C CSS) bridge design. The current gap forces `.px(size.width.rawValue)` on every hop from typed dimensions into spec lengths, which kills the composition story on the landing page. Options: `LengthConvertible` conformance on `Tagged<Extent.X<Space>, Double>`, `.px(_: Tagged<...>)` overloads on `CSS.Length`, or explicit-always. The decision generalizes — every primitive→spec handoff in the ecosystem faces the same question (time primitives → ISO 8601 string, geometry → CSS length, geometry → PDF point, etc.).
- [ ] **[skill]** documentation: Strengthen `[DOC-050]` (Code Example Quality) to require that every type and initializer in example code be traced to a production source file before the example is committed — not just "domain-meaningful identifiers." Motivated by three rounds of incorrect example syntax this session written from READMEs alone. Concrete addition: a "source verification" checklist row in `[DOC-050]`, and a cross-reference to the verify-before-asserting memory rule.
- [ ] **[blog]** "Four imports, four layers" (working title) — pattern-documentation post capturing the design rationale for the landing-page layers-necessity SHOW once the progressive example ships. First-principles mode per `[BLOG-010]`: start from "a Swift landing that reads as API documentation," walk through why comparator sites work/don't, arrive at the four-station progression + DocC directives that make it DocC-native. Backing receipts: this reflection + `landing-page-user-journey.md` + the rendered live site.

## Cleanup

**Handoff triage** per `[REFL-009]`:

- `HANDOFF.md` — triaged. Contains active Next Steps (progressive example unresolved; not pushed). Contains supervisor ground-rules block authored at session end per `[HANDOFF-012]`. Per `[REFL-009]` disposition table, the block is a fresh dispatch for the next session; annotation is `pending verification — fresh dispatch, no work yet`. File left in place. Annotation added below the block.
- Other `HANDOFF-*.md` files at `/Users/coen/Developer/swift-institute/` root: none to triage (the session didn't create any branching handoffs).

**Audit findings** per `[REFL-010]`: `/audit` was not invoked this session; no audit status updates.
