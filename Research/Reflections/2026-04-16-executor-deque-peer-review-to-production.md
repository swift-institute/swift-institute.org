# Executor Deque: Peer Review to Production via Supervised Implementation

## What Happened

Three-phase session spanning research review, design discussion, and supervised implementation.

**Phase 1 — Peer review.** Read 7 research notes + 1 experiment spike constituting the swift-executors v1 research corpus. Wrote a formal peer review (`swift-executors/Research/prompts/peer-review-report.md`) covering corpus-level consistency, per-note correctness/completeness/rigor/risk, cross-cutting observations, and 3 disputed recommendations. Key findings: (a) the FIFO-everywhere v1 assumption has an unstated head-of-line blocking latency bound that should be documented, (b) Cooperative re-entrancy is a correctness gap (the stdlib itself has a `shouldStop` clobber bug), (c) the `priorityTracking` default of `false` on Darwin means most users never benefit from M3 thread-QoS override.

**Phase 2 — Design discussion.** Addressed 5 open questions for the production `Executor.Job.Deque` (`swift-executors/Research/prompts/deque-design-discussion.md`): element lifecycle safety (stealer's speculative read is safe because `UnownedJob` is `BitwiseCopyable`), type shape (`~Copyable` struct matching siblings), API surface (`push -> Bool`, all `public`, non-mutating), naming (`Executor.Job.Deque` base, `.Static<N>` variant), and ManagedBuffer lifecycle (no concerns; cache base pointer at init).

**Phase 3 — Supervised implementation.** Authored supervisor ground rules (`HANDOFF-supervisor-rules.md`, later merged into `HANDOFF.md` Constraints) per the `/supervise` skill. 6 rules protecting: cached base pointer (not per-call closure), no generics/resize, non-mutating ops, exact atomic orderings, sibling conventions, escalation triggers. The implementing agent produced 6 files (2 modified, 4 created) across `swift-executor-primitives` (L1) and `swift-executors` (L3). All 6 ground rules verified. All 6 acceptance criteria verified. Build clean, 25 tests passing.

Key supervision interventions: approved Package.swift scope expansion (add swift-memory-primitives, add Test Support module), accepted Worker.swift L3 migration (necessary but should have been escalated). No drift signals detected.

## What Worked and What Didn't

**Worked well:**
- The three-phase arc (review → design → supervise) was effective. The peer review built deep context that directly informed the ground rules. Without having traced the atomic orderings through the research notes and spike, I could not have written Rule #4 (exact ordering match) with confidence.
- Ground rules as a concise constraint format (4-6 entries, typed) were effective at preventing drift. The implementing agent never retreaded a rejected alternative.
- The design discussion's non-mutating insight (Q2/Q3) was load-bearing — it enabled the `~Copyable` struct shape to work with concurrent access. The implementing agent confirmed `Memory.Inline.pointer(at:)` is non-mutating, validating the pattern for the Static variant.
- The implementing agent correctly escalated Package.swift changes and the UnownedJob factory need, per Rule #6.

**Didn't work:**
- The implementing agent modified Worker.swift (L3 consumer) without escalating per Rule #6. The change was correct (mechanical API migration) but the process gap meant I couldn't verify it until after the fact. Sub-agent supervision has no mid-flight intervention points — the sub-agent caveat in [SUPER-001] applies.
- The `@_alignment(128)` dead end (from the alignment spike) was discovered before this session but was relevant context for the NUMA note's revised padding recommendation. The peer review initially flagged CacheLine.Padded alignment propagation as a concern; the spike had already resolved it. Better cross-referencing between the spike results and the research notes would have prevented the stale concern.

## Patterns and Root Causes

**Pattern: Review-as-context-building.** The peer review was not just a quality gate — it was the most effective way to build the deep context needed for supervision. Ground rules authored without having reviewed the research would have been surface-level ("follow the handoff") rather than substantive ("the atomic orderings are load-bearing because Lê et al. 2013 corrected a weak-memory bug in the original Chase-Lev paper"). The supervision skill's [SUPER-002] 4-6 entry format forces compression, and compression requires understanding.

**Pattern: Non-mutating as a concurrent-access enabler.** The `~Copyable` struct shape works for Chase-Lev because `Atomic` operations and `UnsafeMutablePointer` dereferences are non-mutating. This is not obvious from the type signatures — `Atomic.store` looks like it should be mutating, but it operates on the atomic's storage address directly. This insight generalizes: any `~Copyable` struct that wraps concurrent primitives (atomics, unsafe pointers) can be used with concurrent borrowing access, as long as no stored property is mutated. This is a design pattern worth documenting.

**Pattern: Supervised implementation scales review context.** A single reviewer cannot both review a research corpus AND implement the result — the context load is too high. Splitting into reviewer (who becomes supervisor) and implementer (who reads only the handoff) is an effective division. The ground rules are the interface: they compress the reviewer's context into actionable constraints the implementer can hold in working memory.

## Action Items

- [ ] **[skill]** supervise: Add guidance that L3 consumer API migrations triggered by L1 API changes should be listed in the handoff's Changed Files section (not left to the implementer to discover), or explicitly called out in the ground rules as expected scope. The Worker.swift escalation gap was caused by the handoff not anticipating the L3 cascade.
- [ ] **[skill]** implementation: Document the "non-mutating concurrent access" pattern — `~Copyable` structs wrapping `Atomic` and `UnsafeMutablePointer` properties can support concurrent borrowing because the operations don't mutate stored properties. This is the Chase-Lev deque pattern but generalizes to any concurrent primitive wrapper.
- [ ] **[package]** swift-executors: The Worker.swift lock-wrapping of all deque operations (`wait.withLock { deque.push/take/steal }`) was correct for the sequential placeholder but is over-synchronized for Chase-Lev. Removing the locks to exploit lock-free properties is a separate Stealing executor design task — track as a v1 optimization item in `work-stealing-scheduler-design.md`.
