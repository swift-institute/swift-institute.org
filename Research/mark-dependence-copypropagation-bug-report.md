# Swift Bug Report: mark_dependence CopyPropagation Interaction

## Context

CopyPropagation (OSSACanonicalizeOwned) bails out on `OperandOwnership::PointerEscape`. When `~Escapable` types use `@_lifetime(borrow)`, the generated `mark_dependence` instructions are classified as `PointerEscape`, causing partial canonicalization that leads to double `end_lifetime` on `~Copyable ~Escapable` values across control flow joins. The compiler team has a TODO comment at `OSSACanonicalizeOwned.cpp:40-46` acknowledging this interaction.

## Question

File a bug report with the standalone reproducer from `copypropagation-nonescapable-mark-dependence` experiment. The reproducer requires: 3 modules, `~Copyable ~Escapable` type with `@_lifetime(borrow)` init, `_read` coroutine yielding the type, and control flow (if/else) after the yield.

## Analysis

Root cause chain: `~Escapable` + `@_lifetime(borrow base)` → `mark_dependence [unresolved/escaping]` → `PointerEscape` classification → partial canonicalization bailout → double `end_lifetime` generation.

The fix applied in the ecosystem: remove `~Escapable` from Property.View (the coroutine scope already prevents escape).

## Outcome

_Bug report pending filing._
