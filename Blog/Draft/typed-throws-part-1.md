# Typed throws in Swift, part 1: error handling from first principles

Here's what typed error handling looks like when the language carries the type:

```swift
struct Port {
    let value: Int

    init(_ string: some StringProtocol) throws(Port.Error) {
        guard let port = Int(string) else {
            throw .invalid(String(string))
        }
        guard (1...65535).contains(port) else {
            throw .outOfRange(port)
        }
        self.value = port
    }
}
```

```swift
do {
    let port = try Port("8080")
} catch {
    switch error {
    case .invalid(let string):
        print("'\(string)' is not a number")
    case .outOfRange(let port):
        print("Port \(port) out of range")
    }
}
```

The error type is in the signature. The catch is checked against that type — exhaustive, no recovery casts, no defensive fallback.

Swift didn't always let us write this. To understand why it matters, let's start from the beginning.

## Return a special value

The oldest approach. Use a sentinel value to signal failure:

```swift
func parsePort(_ string: String) -> Int {
    guard let port = Int(string), (1...65535).contains(port) else {
        return -1
    }
    return port
}
```

This compiles. It runs. And it's a trap.

```swift
let port = parsePort("hello")
// port is -1 — but -1 is a valid Int
// Nothing stops us from using it
let configuration = Service.Configuration(
    host: "localhost", port: port, maxRetries: 3
)
// configuration.port is now -1
// A bug that will surface far from its cause
```

What does -1 mean? The caller has to know. The compiler can't distinguish -1-as-error from -1-as-value. And if the caller forgets to check, the bad value flows silently through the program.

We need the error to be part of the type.

## Make the error a type

`Result` makes the success/failure distinction explicit:

```swift
func parsePort(
    _ string: String
) -> Result<Int, Port.Error> {
    guard let port = Int(string) else {
        return .failure(.invalid(string))
    }
    guard (1...65535).contains(port) else {
        return .failure(.outOfRange(port))
    }
    return .success(port)
}
```

Now the error type is right there in the signature: `Result<Int, Port.Error>`. The caller can't ignore it — they must unwrap the `Result` to get the value. And the compiler knows *exactly* which errors are possible: `.invalid` when the string isn't a number, `.outOfRange` when the number falls outside 1–65535.

The error type is visible. But `Result` is a container — it composes through `flatMap` and `mapError`, not through linear code. What happens when we compose multiple fallible operations?

## The cost of composition

Let's add a second parsing function and try to build a configuration:

```swift
func parseRetries(
    _ string: String
) -> Result<Int, Retries.Error> {
    guard let n = Int(string) else {
        return .failure(.invalid(string))
    }
    guard n >= 0 else {
        return .failure(.negative(n))
    }
    return .success(n)
}
```

Now combine them. But there's a problem: `parsePort` returns `Result<Int, Port.Error>` and `parseRetries` returns `Result<Int, Retries.Error>`. Different error types — different domains. To compose them, we first need a common error type and must map each leaf into it:

```swift
let configuration = parsePort("8080")
    .mapError(Service.Error.port)
    .flatMap { port in
        parseRetries("3")
            .mapError(Service.Error.retries)
            .map { retries in
                Service.Configuration(
                    host: "localhost",
                    port: port,
                    maxRetries: retries
                )
            }
    }
// configuration: Result<Service.Configuration, Service.Error>
```

Two operations, two levels of nesting, and two `.mapError` calls to unify the error types. Three fields would be three levels. A real configuration with ten fields would be unreadable.

Compare this with the opening: `let port = try Port(...)` — one line, no nesting, no closures, no manual error mapping. The code that *does the work* dominates the code that *handles errors*, not the other way around.

We gained precision — each operation declares exactly which errors it can produce, the compiler enforces handling — but we paid for it in ergonomics.

## Let the language carry the error

Swift's `throws` keyword solves the ergonomics problem:

```swift
func parsePort(_ string: String) throws -> Int {
    guard let port = Int(string) else {
        throw Port.Error.invalid(string)
    }
    guard (1...65535).contains(port) else {
        throw Port.Error.outOfRange(port)
    }
    return port
}
```

And composition becomes linear:

```swift
func parseConfiguration(
    _ dict: [String: String]
) throws -> Service.Configuration {
    guard let host = dict["host"] else {
        throw Service.Error.missing("host")
    }
    let port = try parsePort(dict["port"] ?? "")
    let retries = try parseRetries(dict["max_retries"] ?? "")

    return Service.Configuration(
        host: host, port: port, maxRetries: retries
    )
}
```

The `flatMap` pyramid is gone. The `.mapError` calls are gone. Each step is a single line. `try` marks every point where control might transfer. The compiler enforces that you handle errors — you can't call a `throws` function without `try` or wrapping it in a `do`/`catch`.

The syntax is clean. Linear. Each step reads as intent. But notice what we lost: we have to write `Port.Error.invalid(...)` — the full path — because the compiler doesn't know the error type. Compare that with the opening's `throw .invalid(...)`. That dot syntax is only possible when the compiler knows the error type from the signature.

And there's a deeper loss. `parsePort` throws `Port.Error`. `parseRetries` throws `Retries.Error`. `parseConfiguration` adds its own `Service.Error`. Three error domains — all erased to `any Error`. The domain structure we designed with leaf error types is invisible to the caller.

Now look at the call site.

## The cost of erasure

```swift
do {
    let configuration = try parseConfiguration(pairs)
    startServer(configuration)
} catch {
    // error: any Error
    print("Failed: \(error)")
}
```

What is `error`? It's `any Error` — an existential that could be *anything*. We know what `parseConfiguration` throws — `Port.Error` from port parsing, `Retries.Error` from retries parsing, `Service.Error` for missing keys. The compiler doesn't.

You *can* cast to recover the type:

```swift
do {
    let port = try parsePort("8080")
} catch let error as Port.Error {
    switch error {
    case .invalid(let string):
        print("'\(string)' is not a number")
    case .outOfRange(let port):
        print("Port \(port) out of range")
    }
} catch {
    // The compiler forces this branch.
    // We know it can't happen. But the compiler doesn't.
    print("Unexpected error: \(error)")
}
```

This compiles. But consider what you're doing:

- **Runtime recovery of compile-time information.** The throw site knew the type — `Port.Error`. The catch site casts to get it back. You're doing the compiler's job at runtime.
- **Silent breakage.** If the error type changes, the `as` cast stops matching. No compiler diagnostic. The catch-all absorbs the error silently.
- **Forced dead code.** That final `catch` is dead code — `parsePort` only throws `Port.Error`. But the compiler demands it because it can't see through the erasure.
- **No exhaustiveness guarantee.** If a case is added to `Port.Error`, the switch doesn't warn. You discover the gap at runtime, not compile time.

With `parseConfiguration`, it's worse: three error domains flow through one `throws`. The caller must guess which types to cast for, with no guidance from the signature.

Compare this with the opening: no cast, no catch-all, exhaustive `switch` directly on the error. The syntax is right, but the *types* are wrong. We erased the very information that makes error handling precise.

This is the **cost of erasure**: you trade type information for syntax. And every caller pays whether they want precision or not.

## A deliberate choice

The type erasure in `throws` wasn't an accident. When Swift first shipped, the core team considered typed throws and deliberately deferred it. The concern: declaring error types in public signatures makes them part of the API contract — a resilience hazard. Java's checked exceptions demonstrated exactly this failure mode.

For many APIs, erasure is still the right choice: a networking function might throw dozens of underlying error types, and the caller wants to retry or show a message, not match every case. But years of real-world Swift revealed cases where erasure genuinely costs you: internal APIs where you control both sides, domain errors that callers need to match exhaustively, and error propagation across module boundaries where `as?` casting feels brittle.

In 2023, [SE-0413](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0413-typed-throws.md) introduced typed throws. The syntax: `throws(E)`.

## The synthesis

Here's the code from the opening — but now you can see what each line resolves.

The leaf error type — only the cases port parsing can produce:

```swift
extension Port {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        case invalid(String)
        case outOfRange(Int)
    }
}
```

Two cases. `Port.Error.invalid` — the input wasn't a number. `Port.Error.outOfRange` — the number wasn't in range. The type nesting carries the domain: this is a *port* error. No need to encode "port" in the case name.

The value type:

```swift
struct Port {
    let value: Int
}
```

The throwing initializer — defined in an extension so the memberwise `init(value:)` remains available:

```swift
extension Port {
    init(_ string: some StringProtocol) throws(Port.Error) {
        guard let port = Int(string) else {
            throw .invalid(String(string))
        }
        guard (1...65535).contains(port) else {
            throw .outOfRange(port)
        }
        self.value = port
    }
}
```

`throws(Port.Error)` gives us what untyped `throws` couldn't: the error type *in the signature*. And `throw .invalid(...)` uses dot syntax — the compiler infers the error type from the declaration. Compare this with the untyped version's `throw Port.Error.invalid(...)`. The type annotation does double duty: it informs the caller *and* simplifies the implementation.

The call site:

```swift
do {
    let port = try Port("8080")
} catch {
    switch error {
    case .invalid(let string):
        print("'\(string)' is not a number")
    case .outOfRange(let port):
        print("Port \(port) out of range")
    }
}
```

No `as?` cast. No dead branch. The `switch` is exhaustive because the compiler knows the error type. This is the synthesis: `Result`'s type precision, with `throws`'s ergonomic syntax.

When operations compose, leaf errors compose too:

```swift
enum Service {}
```

```swift
extension Service {
    struct Configuration {
        var host: String
        var port: Port
        var maxRetries: Retries
    }
}
```

`Retries` mirrors `Port` — a struct wrapping an `Int`, with `init(_ string: some StringProtocol) throws(Retries.Error)`. The configuration stores domain types directly, not the raw `Int` values from the earlier approaches.

```swift
extension Service {
    enum Error: Swift.Error {
        case missing(String)
        case port(Port.Error)
        case retries(Retries.Error)
    }
}
```

Each leaf error is wrapped in a case that names the domain. `Service.Error.port(Port.Error)` — a port error, within the service domain. The structure mirrors the domain.

```swift
func parseConfiguration(
    _ dict: [String: String]
) throws(Service.Error) -> Service.Configuration {
    guard let host = dict["host"] else {
        throw .missing("host")
    }
    let port: Port
    do {
        port = try Port(dict["port"] ?? "")
    } catch {
        throw .port(error)
    }
    let retries: Retries
    do {
        retries = try Retries(dict["max_retries"] ?? "")
    } catch {
        throw .retries(error)
    }
    return Service.Configuration(
        host: host, port: port, maxRetries: retries
    )
}
```

Each `do`/`catch` wraps a leaf error into the parent domain. The compiler knows the type at every boundary — `error` in the first `catch` is `Port.Error`, and `.port(error)` wraps it into `Service.Error`. No casts. No guessing. The domain structure that `throws` erased is explicit again.

## What's next

We have the syntax. `throws(E)` gives us typed errors at catch sites and dot syntax in implementations. `Port.Error`, `Retries.Error`, and `Service.Error` show how leaf errors compose at domain boundaries.

But what is the actual relationship between non-throwing functions, `throws(E)`, and untyped `throws`? And when you pass `Port.init` to a higher-order function like `map`, does the error type survive?

That's [Part 2](/blog/typed-throws-part-2).
